# Operating conditions correction

The output of a thermal anemometer depends onde the electronic characteristics of the sensor but on the fluid conditions as well. Temperature, pressure and composition will affect the measurements if they are different from the calibration conditions. Changes in the properties of the fluid will mean changes in anemometer output and the result should be corrected accordingly.


## Simplest correction: constant fluid properties

The simplest possible correction considers that fluid properties are constant and don't change with pressure, temperature and assumes that the fluid composition is constant.
